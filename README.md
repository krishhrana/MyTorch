# MyTorch
A re-implementation of the PyTorch Library

## Numpy Implementations
Folders [Multi Layer Perceptron](Multi%20Layer%20Perceptron), [Convolution Neural Network](Convolution%20Neural%20Networks), [Recurrent Neural Network](Recurrent%20Networks) contain the source code for the NumPy implementations of layers, activations, loss equations.

### PyTorch Models and Training notebooks
Folders [Attention Based ASR](Attention%20Based%20ASR), [Auto Regressive Language Modelling](Auto%20Regressive%20Language%20Modelling), [Face Recognition and Verification](Face%20Recognition%20and%20Verification), [MLP Based ASR](MLP%20Based%20ASR), [Phoneme Level ASR](Phoneme%20Level%20ASR) contain the training notebooks for the models implemented in PyTorch.
